# PAF tools

A meta tool has been created in order to facilitate the use of this framework, providing a single access point to work with PAF. This tool has been designed taking into account several aspects but mainly to be intuitive and self-explained. A helpful feature of this tool is the autocomplete when you press Tab key in a bash terminal so feel free to pry it.

To execute this tool, you should have defined some environment variables. This is the ```source``` of your ROOT installation and the ```source``` of PAF. You can see all the tools installed if you execute the tool without parameters. Furthermore, you have always the help with in each tool performing the command with ```-h``` or ```--help``` parameter:
```sh
$ paf reset -h
Resets the PAF environment by closing any session that might be opened and deleting any file created.
        "-a | --aggresive" Aggressive cleaning of files in the packages not in the official list. If this is not specified the Makefile and the PROOF-INFO directory are left untouched. Note that unless these files already exist, they are created by PAF.
```

By default, the tool show all the possiblities that are currently installed:
```sh
$ paf                                
paf tool_name [tool_parameters]                                 
PAF tools currently available:
        createselector
        inspecttree
        reset    
```

## PAF::InspectTree
It provides information about a ROOT file specified as the last parameter. It can describe the ROOT file showing the TTrees inside, the TBranches of this trees, the type per each branch, the description given by the creator of the file or a snippet of code to use directly in one analysis. It is very useful when you are working with PAF. 

```sh
$ paf inspecttree -h
        "-h | --help" to show command help.
        "-b | --branch branchname" to retrieve information about specified branch.
        "-t | --tree treename"  to retrieve information about specified tree.
        "-s | --snippet" to show a code snippet for each variable.
         ROOT file name. Mandatory.
```

Here is an output example:
```sh
$ paf inspecttree -b T_Gen* -t Tree /home/javier/Documents/Tree_ZJets_Madgraph_0.root
Type: vector<int> 		Variable: T_Gen_Muon_PID
Type: vector<float> 		Variable: T_Gen_Muon_Px
Type: vector<float> 		Variable: T_Gen_Muon_Py
Type: vector<float> 		Variable: T_Gen_Muon_Pz
(...)
Type: vector<float> 		Variable: T_Gen_TauSt3_LepDec_Py
Type: vector<float> 		Variable: T_Gen_TauSt3_LepDec_Pz
Type: vector<float> 		Variable: T_Gen_TauSt3_LepDec_Energy
```

## PAF::CreateSelector
In this case, the tool creates the basic structure to develop an analysis, you only need to specify the desired name and it will create the files with the default methods to implement a correct analysis.
```sh
$ paf createselector 
createselector command is not a valid expression.
Command expression:
paf createselector selector_name
```

## PAF::Reset
When ROOT and PAF are working, they generate a lot of both of temporal and blocking files. This files are controlling parts of the execution, but sometimes, we need to remove them because we are having unexpected errors, o we need to simulate a complete initialization or simply because we are looking for a clean environment. In this cases, you can execute ```paf reset```, or even stronger ```paf reset -f```which forces the removal.

```sh
$ paf reset
>> Removing .paf, .proof and ~/.proof
```
