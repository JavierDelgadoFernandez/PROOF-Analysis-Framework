# PAF::PAF selector functions
Until now, we have made a quick review around some PAF functionalities. We have created an analyzer but here we are going to explain all functions that PAF chain selector provides.

## Getting tree variables
We will start from the most basic function. That is the way through we get a variable from a Tree. In the previous example, we showed it but not all of its powerful.

To all those people who do not have a deep knowledge of C++, we have created 3 predefines functions to facilitate the getting of primitive type of variables, these are GetFloat, GetInt and GetDouble, however, we recomend the template method Get&lt;T&gt; which allow us to get all types of variable.

All getting methods needs at least the key as parameter, that is the name of the Branch to search.
```cpp
GetFloat("T_METPF_ET");
```

But if we need an item from a vector, we have overloaded that functions with two parameters, the key and the position in that vector:
```cpp
GetFloat("TODO", 1);
```
That call will return the second item from the vector "T_Elec_Px".

And, here are some examples of getting variables with the template and recomended method:
```cpp
Get<float>("T_METPF_ET");
Get<float>("T_Elec_Px", 1);
```

## Tree variables assignation
PAF offers another way to work with variables from tree. In this case, we tell to PAF where we want the value of a key. The main advantage of this feature consist in we do not need to specify the type of that variable, C++ will infer during compiling time.
```cpp
float result;
Assign("T_METPF_ET", result);
```
And, if we need to get an item from an array variable, we have the next overloaded function:
```cpp
float result;
Assign("T_Elec_Px", result, 1);
```

## Working with parameters
When we want to read parameters from previous selector or project specified, we have a similar methods to a tree variable. The function name will be in this case GetParam&lt;T&gt; or primitive type predefined GetParamFloat, GetParamInt and GetParamDobule, but due to we do not contemplate the use of array, we do not have something like GetParam&lt;T&gt;("Prueba", 0) yet.

But the parameters needs other function cause we need to set a parameter if we want to use it in other selectors. So, we have a SetParam that needs a key and the value. 

In this example, we will set "Test" key with the value of test variable and then we recover the value.
```cpp
float test;
SetParam("Prueba", test);
(...)
float result = GetParam<float>("Test");
```
And there are other ways to get the value of "test":
```cpp
float result = GetParamFloat("Test");
```
Or with an AssingParam:
```cpp
float result;
AssignParam("Test", result);
```

## Branchs and Leafs functions
An intereset function is a query to know if the current event has a specific variable. We have a function that need the variable name and return a boolean. For example:
```cpp
bool result = Exists("T_METPF_ET")
```
Of course, PAF also provides tools to work in a lower level if the user wants it. That is the direct access to Branchs and Leafs of the current Tree. There are two functions, GetBranch and GetLeaf that from the key, they will return a pointer to that object.
Example for a Leaf:
```cpp
TLeaf* result = GetLeaf("T_METPF_ET");
```
Example for a Branch:
```cpp
TBranch* result = GetBranch("T_METPF_ET");
```

## Helper functions
PAF also has some functions to help in common tasks like histograms or trees creation, or object searches. Here are some examples but not all, if you want to know all of that functions, please, go to classes documentation in PAF [TODO URL] due to these kind of functions are a bit volatile:
```cpp
TObject* result = FindInput("foo");
TObject* result = FindOutput("foo");
TTree* result = CreateTree("name", "title");
TH1F* result = CreateH1F("name", "title", nbinsx, xlow, xup);
(...)
TH1D* result = CreateH1F("name", "title", nbinsx, xlow, xup);
(...)
TH2F* result = CreateH2F("name", "title", nbinsx, xbins, nbinsy, ybins);
(...)
TProfile* result = CreateProfile("name", "title", nbinsx, xlow, xup, ylow, yup);
```
