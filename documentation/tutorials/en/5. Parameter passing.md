# PAF::Parameter passing
PAF allow us to pass parameters between selectors using an easy way. This parameters could be created during PAFProject configuration or during a previous selector execution (Obviously when we use several chained selectors). In this tutorial we are going to show how to create and use them.

We will create a selector that will take the variable specified in a PAFProject and save the value in other parameter. Then we will create another selector to draw the value saved in the previous selector.

## Creating a parameter from PAFProject.
When we configure the PAFProject, we only need to add a line (before calling to myProject->Run() obviously) like that:
```cpp
myProject->SetInputParam("Variable", "T_METPF_ET");
```

Here is an example of this PAFProject script.
```cpp
	PAFProject* myProject = new PAFProject(new PAFPROOFLiteEnvironment(4));
	
	myProject->AddDataFile("/home/javier/Documents/Tree_ZJets_Madgraph_0.root");

	myProject->SetInputParam("Variable", "T_METPF_ET");
	
	myProject->AddSelectorPackage("MyVariableGetter");
	myProject->AddSelectorPackage("MyVariablePainter");
	
	myProject->Run();
```

## Setting a parameter in the selector.
The first selector, that will be called "MyVariableGetter", needs to use the SetParam function to save the parameter. This function requires a key, "Result" in this case and the value.
```cpp
SetParam("Result", result);
```

MyVariableGetter.h complete:
```cpp
	#pragma once

	#include "../PAF/computing/PAFChainItemSelector.h"

	class MyVariableGetter : public PAFChainItemSelector {
		public:
			MyVariableGetter() : PAFChainItemSelector() {}
			virtual ~MyVariableGetter() {}

		protected:
			virtual void InsideLoop();
		
		ClassDef(MyVariableGetter, 1);
	};
```

MyVariableGetter.cpp complete:
```cpp
	#include "MyVariableGetter.h"

	ClassImp(MyVariableGetter)

	void MyVariableGetter::InsideLoop() {
		TString variable = GetParam<TString>("Variable");
		float result = GetFloat("T_METPF_ET");
		SetParam("Result", result);
	}
```

## Getting the value of a parameter
Although in the previous section we could see how to get a parameter, here we could see that regardless where we have created (PAFProject configuration or previous chain selector) the way to get it is the same. We will use GetParam to get it. In this particular case, we need to get the "Result" as a float so:
```cpp
double number = GetParamFloat("Result");
```
MyVariablePainter.h complete:
```cpp
	#pragma once

	#include "../PAF/computing/PAFChainItemSelector.h"

	#include <TH1F.h>

	class MyVariablePainter : public PAFChainItemSelector {
		public:
			MyVariablePainter() : PAFChainItemSelector(), myHistogram(0) {}
			virtual ~MyVariablePainter() {}

		protected:
			virtual void Initialise();
			virtual void InsideLoop();
			virtual void Summary();

		protected:
			TH1F* myHistogram;
		
		ClassDef(MyVariablePainter, 1);
	};
```

MyVariablePainter.cpp complete:
```cpp
	#include "MyVariablePainter.h"

	#include "TCanvas.h"

	ClassImp(MyVariablePainter)

	void MyVariablePainter::Initialise() {
		myHistogram = CreateH1F("myHistogram","#slash{E}_{T}", 100, 0., 200.);
	}

	void MyVariablePainter::InsideLoop() {
		float result = GetParamFloat("Result");
		myHistogram->Fill(result);
	}

	void MyVariablePainter::Summary() {
		TCanvas* c1 = new TCanvas("c1", "myHistogram canvas",200,10,400,400);
		myHistogram = dynamic_cast<TH1F*>(fOutput->FindObject("myHistogram"));
		if (myHistogram) myHistogram->Draw();
		c1->Update();
	}
```

And now we could launch it an test if it works successfully.

PAF allow us to pass any object or primitive type, but it is recommended to use object that inherits from TObject.
